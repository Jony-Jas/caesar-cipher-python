In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.

### To usee Caesar Cipher:

* Clone this repo usig `git clone https://github.com/Jony-Jas/caesar-cipher-python/`
* Run `main.py` file using any python compiler
* Type `encode` to start encoding or `decode` to decode a message
* Enjoy *:)*
